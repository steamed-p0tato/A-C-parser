READ ME:

I TRIED TO MAKE A COMPILER FOR C BUT ITS TOO MUCH WORK SO 
I AM ONLY WRITING A PARSER.. IT TOOK BLOOD AND TEARS (LITERALLY)
IVE BEEN AWAKE FOR NIGHTS AND READ A MANUAL TO MAKE IT
MY ROLE MODLES ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST PEOPLE LIKE LINUS TORVALDS AND STEVE WOZNIAK AND RICHARD STALLMAN
BUT I AM AWARE THAT I CAN NEVER BE AS GREAT AS MY HEROS... I AM JUST NOT AS INTELLIGENT
I TRY MY BEST KNOWING AM NOT ENOUGH BUT I WILL KEEP TRYING
IVE NEVER BEEN THE BEST STUDENT OR THE SON MY PARENTS DESERVED 
BUT I WILL TRY TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT I AM NOW


NEXT UP I WILL BE BUILDING A RTOS LIKE KERNEL HOPEFULLY I CAN FOSS IT 
THEN I WILL TRY MY HAND INTO TRYING TO BUILD AN INTERPRETER
